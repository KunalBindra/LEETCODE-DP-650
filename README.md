# LEETCODE-DP-650
Sure, let's dry-run the `minSteps` method from the `Solution` class. The goal of this method is to find the minimum number of steps required to produce `n` 'A's using two operations: copy all and paste.

### Explanation

The `minSteps` method uses dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

1. **Initialization:**
   - An integer array `dp` of size `n + 1` is initialized to keep track of the minimum steps required to produce `i` 'A's, where `i` ranges from 0 to `n`.

2. **Base Case:**
   - The value of `dp[0]` is not explicitly set but is default initialized to 0 because we don't need any steps to produce 0 'A's.

3. **Loop through each number from 2 to `n`:**
   - For each `i`, initially assume the minimum steps to get `i` 'A's is `i`. This corresponds to copying 'A' once and pasting it `i - 1` times.
   - Then, check if `i` can be divided evenly by any number `j` from `i / 2` down to 2. If `i % j == 0`, it means you can reach `i` 'A's by pasting `dp[j]` (the steps to get `j` 'A's) exactly `i / j` times.

4. **Update `dp[i]`:**
   - If `i % j == 0` is true, update `dp[i]` with the minimum of the previously computed value and `dp[j] + i / j`. The value `dp[j] + i / j` represents the steps required to get `i` 'A's by copying `j` 'A's and pasting it `i / j` times.

5. **Return `dp[n]`:**
   - After filling up the `dp` array, `dp[n]` will contain the minimum number of steps required to get `n` 'A's.

### Dry Run Example

Letâ€™s dry run the algorithm with `n = 6`:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `dp = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` (Initially, each `dp[i]` is set to `i`.)

2. **Processing i = 2:**
   - `dp[2]` is set to `2` (initially `2`).
   - No valid `j` found (as `2 / 2` is `1`, which is less than `2`), so `dp[2]` remains `2`.

3. **Processing i = 3:**
   - `dp[3]` is set to `3`.
   - No valid `j` found (as `3 / 2` is `1`, which is less than `2`), so `dp[3]` remains `3`.

4. **Processing i = 4:**
   - `dp[4]` is set to `4`.
   - `4 % 2 == 0`, so `dp[4] = dp[2] + 4 / 2 = 2 + 2 = 4`. This is a valid and optimal solution.

5. **Processing i = 5:**
   - `dp[5]` is set to `5`.
   - No valid `j` found (as `5 / 2` is `2`, which is less than `5`), so `dp[5]` remains `5`.

6. **Processing i = 6:**
   - `dp[6]` is set to `6`.
   - `6 % 3 == 0`, so `dp[6] = dp[3] + 6 / 3 = 3 + 2 = 5`. This is a valid and optimal solution.

### Final State

- `dp[6]` ends up as `5`.

The final output for `n = 6` is `5`, which means it takes a minimum of 5 steps to produce 6 'A's.
